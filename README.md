# Mages
MC Plugin fo my custom Mages minigame

# Summary
This is an old MineCraft Bukkit plugin I developed for playing a chess-like 4v4 minigame. One player from each team 'places' their teammates on the board and gives them certain roles, which they use to best their opponents.
This accompanies a custom map I made which is necessary for playing this game. The game logic is tied closely with the materials and architecture of the arena I made, so I highly recommend you use that map.

# Rules
Mages is a 4v4 multiplayer game. The game takes place on a giant game board (think chess) where each space on the board is a different color. The leader of the team picks places on the board to summon his players to. 
The major tile types allow users on them to do the following things:
Light Green: Spawns creepers
Dark Green: Spawns zombies
Light Blue: Spawns cave spiders
White: Spawn snowmen, which defend fellow teammates from approaching mobs. While they're effective at homing in on threats, they only perform knockback and not damage, making them a blockade which can be overwhelmed.
Dark Blue: Spawns water, which pushes teammates or enemies onto new tiles, changing their powers
Red: Spawns blazes which target opponents, and occasionally ignite the board. If the board burns, those areas become unusable
Brown: Spawns saddle and pig, which gives that player agency to traverse to locations they see fit as the game state changes
Black: Spawns endermen, which are used to prevent users and leaders alike from targeting key strategic points on board
